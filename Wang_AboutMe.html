        My name is Jenny Wang and I am a junior in the Engineering Academy at Dublin High School. I am currently enrolled in AP Computer Science Principles. I aspire to become a computer scientist when I grow up. I am interested in this career pathway because I love to create and build things using code. I am a polyglot so I love learning languages and I think code is a lot like learning spoken languages. I also enjoy the design and building process in class. I will achieve this goal by first, actively participating in the Engineering Academy in high school, as well as many engineering centered clubs. This summer, I participated in Kode with Klossy, a program that teaches high school girls how to code. I was in the web development section of the program where we learned how to design and build working websites. 

​

Some traits and characteristics that I possess that are related to this career include creativity, self-motivation and responsibility. Ever since I was a child, I have been invested in visual and performing arts. I especially enjoy drawing, painting, as well as digital art. My original poster and song titled "Restart" won the Grand Prize at the Alameda

County Youth Advisory Board Public Service Announcement Contest. I am self-motivated to perform well in all my classes, and I am constantly challenging myself to do my best. This year, I am taking so of my hardest classes, such as AP United States History, AP Computer Science Principles, AP English Language and Composition, AP Spanish Language and Culture, AP Chemistry and Precalculus. These classes challenge me to organize my daily schedule and taught me to balance my workload. This year, I learned to make time for my own passions and hobbies, while also staying on top of my schoolwork. On top of all that, I am also a singer and songwriter with two singles out on all musical platforms. I sang in the Capitol Choral Festival in Sacramento with my choir. I am responsible because during group projects, I always contribute to the group and do my part while also checking up on the rest of our group to make sure we are not behind on anything. 

​

This year, I actively participate in many clubs on campus. I am the Vice President and Co Founder of Eco at Dublin High School and also the Secretary of Poetry Club. I am also a member of Build Club. Last year, I was accepted into the California All-State Honor Choir and had the opportunity to sing in San Jose along with other singers in the women's choir. Being in a choir teaches me leadership skills and teamwork. My director always stresses the importance of unifying vowels in our voices, and how we can make multiple voices come together as one. I learned how to take initiative to lead my fellow singers during sectionals. I am excited to be more involved in engineering and transfer the same skills I developed in choir to projects and activities. As a member on the Alameda Youth Advisory Board for Tobacco Prevention, I work with fellow board members to organize workshops and conferences, plan for our annual public service announcement contest, and relate our work to the health curriculum at school. 

​

Even though I may have less experience with engineering in the past, I am so excited for the possibilities in my future. Thank you for taking the time to read my introduction and I hope you enjoy the rest of my site!
