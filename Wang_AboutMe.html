             <p>My name is Jenny Wang and I am a junior in the Engineering Academy at Dublin High School. I am currently enrolled in Computer Science Principles and I aspire to become a computer scientist because I love to create and build things using code. Ever since I was little, I had a love of learning languages and I think that code is a lot like learning spoken languages. Last year, I applied and was accepted in the Dublin High Engineering and Design Academy and I took my first Project Lead the Way class: Principles of Engineering. Through this class, I discovered my love for building mechanisms and using code to create simulations demonstrating how they work. Just this summer, I had the opportunity to participate in Kode with Klossy, a program that teaches high school girls how to code. I was in the web development section of the program where we learned how to design and build working websites. After my eye-opening experience at Kode with Klossy, I decided to join the Gael Force Robotics Club at my school to build new skills and learn in a different environment.</p>

           <p>Some traits and characteristics that I possess that are related to this career in computer science include creativity, self-motivation and responsibility. Ever since I was a child, I have been invested in visual and performing arts, especially  drawing, painting, as well as digital art. My original poster and song titled "Restart" won the Grand Prize at the Alameda County Youth Advisory Board Public Service Announcement Contest. I am self-motivated to perform well in all my classes, and I am constantly challenging myself to do my best. This year, I am taking some of my hardest classes, such as AP United States History, AP English Language and Composition, AP Spanish Language and Culture, AP Chemistry and Precalculus. These classes challenge me to organize my daily schedule and teach me to balance my workload. On top of academics, I am also a member of the Robotics Club, Freshman Mentorship Program in which I work on the Executive Board, and the Engineering Mentorship Program.</p>
           <p>This year, I learned to make time for my own passions and hobbies, while also staying on top of my schoolwork. The reason I chose to take on all these activities is because I am genuinely passionate about them, but I also make sure to have time for all my hobbies. In my freshman year, I was an avid member of my high school show choir and I was accepted into the California All State Honor Choir. In my sophomore year, I became a member of the Las Positas Chamber Choir and I sang in the Capitol Choral Festival. My experiences from choir are reflected in the role I take on in group projects at school because being in choir has taught me about responsibility and leadership. One thing my director has always emphasized is the importance of creating one single voice with multiple voices and I try to emulate this quality of teamwork in every single project that I am a part of. I am responsible because during group projects, I always contribute to the group and do my part while also checking up on the rest of our group to make sure we are not behind on anything. As a member of the Alameda Youth Advisory Board for Tobacco Prevention, I work with fellow board members to organize workshops and conferences, plan for our annual public service announcement contest, and relate our work to the health curriculum at school. One of my proudest projects was organizing the annual Teens â€‹Tackle Tobacco conference at UC Berkeley. As one of the coordinators, my responsibilities included managing the different workshops and attendance, writing and delivering the opening speech, arranging my very own musical performance and finally holding my own workshop on the side. </p> 

           <p>Throughout shelter in place, I have been furthering my skills in the realm of computer science as well as art and music! In the midst of these strange times, I personally believe that we should take advantage of the benefits of staying at home. Through the Amazon Future Engineer program, I am learning how to code and remix music using Python. In this era, I definitely believe that it is an opportunity for the expansion of creativity due to the fact that there is a such a massive captive audience. With the abundance of time, I have been inspired to work on my music and I have been writing songs about just about anything! For my AP Chemistry class, I wrote a fun song that included some of the most challenging concepts to memorize (and now I think it's safe to say that I do have those concepts memorized). Finally, I am taking a CS50 course online and expanding the skills that I developed in CSP this year.
