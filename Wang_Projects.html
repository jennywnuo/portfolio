             <p>In this project, my group and I overcame challenges in order to build a fast and efficient vehicle. This vehicle needed to cover a distance of one meter over a short period of time using four different power configurations such as one hydrogen fuel cell, two hydrogen fuel cells, one solar cell and two solar cells. I contributed to the design of the project and created the chain and sprocket system that allowed for the car to move. I also built the casing that held each of the two hydrogen fuel cells. One of the main challenges include the spacing on the vehicle.We had to change our design in the middle of the project in order to fit all four power configurations onto the car. This meant that we needed to add a second story. The second level on the car comes with additional weight, therefore force was something we needed to consider and take into account. I contributed to the documentation, the modifications, initial design as well as the initial design paragraph. I also updated my individual notebook and inputted the group responsibilities in the gantt chart. </p>

             <p>Objective: The goal of this project is to design and test a renewable composite insulation material.. Many of the materials used for insulators aren’t environmentally friendly and in the future end up hurting the environment. To combat this, we are tasked with making an insulator that is renewable and effective using our knowledge on thermodynamics.</p>

             <div style="padding-top:25px;"> 
             <p>In this project, my group and I overcame challenges in order to brainstorm effective materials to combine in order to create this renewable composite insulation material. This composite material must be of one inch thickness, of consistent internal composition, environmentally friendly and economical. ​I contributed to the construction of the material by providing the shredded jeans for the middle section of the insulation. In additional to conducting research on different types of materials and their usefulness, I also helped with the general design. One of the main challenges that my group faced in particular was finding materials that were accessible and useful in such a short period of time. Of course, we wanted to keep within the constraints, so it required a lot of creative thinking and applying what we learned about thermal energy and insulation in class to the project. I contributed to the research, initial design, documentation. modification, testing and data analysis.</p>
