             <p>Duration: Two Weeks (March, 23 2020 - March, 3 2020)</p> 
             <p>Objective: The goal of this project is to use Python to manipulate images and edit them and to use image manipulation to convey a message and solve a problem. This project demonstrates knowledge on algorithms in Python. </p>

             <p>This is by far one of my favorite projects of the year. This project was inspired by abstract artists, and my partner and I created two different options in total, one inspired by Picasso and the other inspired by Kandinsky. Though it was challenging collaborating from home, I think it was overall an interesting experience. One of the first challenges I encountered throughout this project was applying images and shapes on top of the photo rather than using a mask to create a border. To solve this problem, I researched how to draw different geometric shapes in Python. There had to be a lot of communication between my partner and I because we had to make sure neither one of us was deleting something that the other person was working on. To combat this, we created many different versions and test files, and clearly labeled them in the workspace to not cause conflict. We tested code on our individual test files and combined them onto the main file after finding the solution. The freedom of this assignment and abundance of time due to shelter in place allowed me to explore and experiment with code that we didn't cover in class. I researched color manipulation and edited the images to reduce or increase saturation. </p>

             <p>Duration: One Week (September, 3 2019 - September, 11 2019)</p> 
             <p>Objective: The goal of this project is to design and develop an interactive game on Scratch using block code. In this Platformer the user can fundamentally control what happens using the keyboard or mouse and includes multiple states as well as an overall objective. </p>

             <div style="padding-top:25px;"> 
             <p>Throughout this project, one important aspect of the creative process was the ability to collaborate and combine ideas when working with a partner. During our brainstorming session, I thought that it would be more productive to include every single idea, and not to dismiss any of them until there was a clear reason to do so in the end. This helped my partner and I stay open-minded and aware of all our different options. What I found most useful is to encourage effective communication while working in my team. This helped us navigate challenges and difficulties such as scheduling, planning, code errors and more. In this project, my responsibilities included the part of the code and comments, which was done using pair coding. One of the main challenges my partner and I faced during our process was figuring out how to incorporate realistic physics into our game, since it was a platformer game. We resolved the issue by researching online and analyzing code that already exists. Then, we edited the code so that we could incorporate the same aspects into our version. Throughout the project, I contributed to the design and documentation of the game as well as maintained effective communication between both partners. </p>

             <p>Course: Honors Principles of Engineering</p> 
             <p>Duration: Two Weeks (January, 18 2019 - January, 24 2019)</p> 
             <p>Objective: The objective of this project was to understand which designs would produce projectiles that would fly the furthest given the following constraints. In order to accomplish this, we were tasked with designing, creating and testing two prototypes of rockets with the given materials, launched at a specific PSI with a chosen angle to evaluate its distance traveled.</p>
             <p>Type of Project: Group Project (three people)</p>  
             </div> 
             <div style="padding-top:25px;"> 
             <p>In this project, I overcame challenges in order to brainstorm effective designs that will be able to fly the furthest. Due to the fact that this project was largely individual based, I designed two different rockets with variations to the shape of the fin. In class, I finished building my first rocket in a day and spent the rest of the work time perfecting the design by testing it. My first rocket flew relatively far in comparison to the rest of my classmates. After the first launch, I noticed that thinner rockets that were wrapped tightly around the PVC pipe tended to fly further because its shape allows it to build up more pressure. One of the main challenges I faced during this project was contemplating how to make my rocket thinner without being too thin to fit around the pipe. I also needed to figure out how to make the tip of the rocket as small as possible so that it minimizes the air resistance. Overall, my responsibilities in this project were far greater than a typical group project in the class because I constructed two rocket prototypes and worked on the documentation for both designs. </p>

             <p>Duration: Two Weeks (November, 1 2018 - November, 16 2018)</p> 
             <p>Objective: The goal of this project is to design, build and test a prototype to gain the power and speed capabilities of using solar or hydrogen power.</p>

             <p>In this project, my group and I overcame challenges in order to build a fast and efficient vehicle. This vehicle needed to cover a distance of one meter over a short period of time using four different power configurations such as one hydrogen fuel cell, two hydrogen fuel cells, one solar cell and two solar cells. I contributed to the design of the project and created the chain and sprocket system that allowed for the car to move. I also built the casing that held each of the two hydrogen fuel cells. One of the main challenges include the spacing on the vehicle.We had to change our design in the middle of the project in order to fit all four power configurations onto the car. This meant that we needed to add a second story. The second level on the car comes with additional weight, therefore force was something we needed to consider and take into account. I contributed to the documentation, the modifications, initial design as well as the initial design paragraph. I also updated my individual notebook and inputted the group responsibilities in the gantt chart. </p>
